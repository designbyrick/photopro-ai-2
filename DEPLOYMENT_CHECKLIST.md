   # Name: photopro-ai-images (or your choice)
   # Region: us-east-1
   # Uncheck "Block all public access"
   ```

2. **Configure Bucket Policy**
   ```json
   {
       "Version": "2012-10-17",
       "Statement": [
           {
               "Sid": "PublicReadGetObject",
               "Effect": "Allow",
               "Principal": "*",
               "Action": "s3:GetObject",
               "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::your-bucket-name/*"
           }
       ]
   }
   ```

3. **Create IAM User**
   ```bash
   # AWS IAM Console ‚Üí Create user
   # Username: photopro-ai-s3-user
   # Attach policy: AmazonS3FullAccess
   # Create access keys
   # Add keys to Railway environment variables
   ```

### Step 4: Replicate API Setup

1. **Create Replicate Account**
